\title{
Monotonic Spline
}
\description{
Fits a monotonic cubic spline to the data provided, using the penalized constrained least squares method from the \code{mgcv} package.
}
\usage{
makespline(x, y, newX=NULL, nKnots = 6, lower_bound = 10^-3)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
The predictor variable.
}
  \item{y}{
The response variable.  Must be the same length as \code{x}.
}
 \item{newX}{
The points at which to return the value on the fitted spline.  If not specified \code{x} is used.
}
 \item{nKnots}{
The number of knots to use in fitting the spline.
}
 \item{lower_bound}{
The spline cannot drop below this value.
}
}
\details{
This uses the \code{pcls} function from the \pkg{mgcv} package to produce the fit.  The monotonicity constraint is enforced using \code{mono.con} from the same package. The \code{lower_bound} argument is only used on the rare occasions when the fitting function becomes negative or arbitrarily close to zero.  If this does occur \code{lower_bound} is added everywhere to ensure that no one length is given essentially infinite weighting.
}
\value{
Returns a vector of values containing the value of the fit at each point \code{newX}.
}
\references{
Package \pkg{mgcv}.  In particular this function is a modification of an example given in the man page for \code{pcls}.
